Description: Essential system packages
 These are the essential packages on the system, i.e. those which any other
 package can depend on without explicitly specifying a dependency. These
 packages supply all of their core functionality even when unconfigured.
 .
 A pin at priority -1 (do not install) is added to apt_preferences(5)
 for Debian archive packages marked essential that are not desired. This
 prevents 'apt-get dist-upgrade', which installs all the essential
 packages it finds, from installing them.
